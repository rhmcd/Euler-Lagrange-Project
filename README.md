# Euler Lagrange Calculations


# Vision 

The aim of this project is to create an open sourced package for solving the calculus of variations problem of minimizing a function, using a differential transform method, Horner’s method, Laguerre’s method, and Aiden’s Delta Squared Process respectively. The Euler-Lagrange equations are applied to convert the functional into a system of second-order differential equations, which are then approximated using both direct and indirect methods. There will be a heavy emphasis on the educational aspect of this code, as most of the current literature make crucial jumps in the mathematical foundations for said methods, often assuming the reader’s are at a high mathematical proficiency. This project will take approximately two semesters, the first of which creates the methods of which the differential transform method, created in the second semester, will apply.
